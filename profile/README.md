# A collection of ansible roles

Each repository hosts a separate role. I prefer this approach to a Monorepo because this way I can clone and use individual repos depending on the place/work that I am doing.

## Attention
Just in case someone is stumbling over this and wants to use it: These ansible roles are not written with universality in mind. They are written for Debian machines and nothing else.
